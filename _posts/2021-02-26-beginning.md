on 1 Feb 2021, I started a new position at Kobe University in Japan as a tenure-track assistant professor of soil science laboratory!
Before coming here, I spent two fruitful years at Thorsten Dittmar's [ICBM-MPI Bridging Group for Marine Geochemistry](https://uol.de/en/icbm/marine-geochemistry), University of Oldenburg in Germany.

Coming soon...
