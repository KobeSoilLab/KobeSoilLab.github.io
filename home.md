Research in my laboratory is focused on studying the organic carbon cycling in the soil and water environments.
Natural organic matter such as dissolved organic matter (DOM) and soil organic matter (SOM) is a complex mixture of
at least ten thousands of different organic molecules derived from a range of sources. The historical accummulation of
these molecules eventually represents the largest organic carbon reservoirs on Earth - as SOM in soil and DOM in the ocean.
In order to understand how these natural organic mattter is generated and decomposed in the nature, we apply a range of analytical
tools and multivariate statistics.
