## The dawn of the Kida group in the Soil Science Laboratory
![dawn](/assets/img/DSCF6406_350.jpg)  

on 1 Feb 2021, I started a new position at the Department of Applied Biology of Kobe University in Japan as a tenure-track assistant professor of soil science laboratory!
Before coming here, I spent two fruitful years at Thorsten Dittmar's [ICBM-MPI Bridging Group for Marine Geochemistry](https://uol.de/en/icbm/marine-geochemistry), University of Oldenburg in Germany, with excellent folks.  
Future updates will be posted on this page.
