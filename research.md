## Biogeochemistry in Asian mangroves
![Fukido mangrove]()
We have been working in Asian mangroves (currently Japan and Thailand) since 2015 in cooperation with scientists of different backgrounds such as [Ecosystem Ecology](https://www.green.gifu-u.ac.jp/~ohtsuka_lab/top.html), [Environmental Ecology](http://www.waseda.jp/sem-e2-lab/members.html), [Hydrology](https://hydro-takeon.jp/), and [Isotope Geochemistry](https://www.nies.go.jp/researchers-e/204664.html).

Vegetated coastal ecosystems including mangroves are known for their high organic C sequestration potential and high rate of material export to the surrounding coastal ocean.
