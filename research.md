## Biogeochemistry in Asian mangroves

We have been working on Asian mangroves (currently Japan and Thailand) since 2015 in cooperation with scientists of different backgrounds such as [Ecosystem Ecology](https://www.green.gifu-u.ac.jp/~ohtsuka_lab/top.html), [Environmental Ecology](http://www.waseda.jp/sem-e2-lab/members.html), [Hydrology](https://hydro-takeon.jp/), and [Isotope Geochemistry](https://www.nies.go.jp/researchers-e/204664.html).

Despite the recognized organic carbon (OC) sequestration potential of mangrove forests, the ongoing climate change and anthropogenic disturbances pose a great threat to these ecosystems. However, we currently lack the ability to mechanically understand and predict the consequences of such impacts, primarily because mechanisms underlying OC stabilization in these ecosystems remain elusive. Research into OC stabilization has focused on terrestrial soils and marine sediments for decades, overlooking the vegetated coastal ecosystems including mangroves. We aim to unravel the mechanisms how mangrove OC can persist for a long term.

Another important aspect of mangroves are their high rate of material export to the surrpounding ocean. The outwelling of mangrove-derived materials to the ocean depend heavily on the geomorphology and hydrology of mangroves. We have developed a hydrologic model that can quantify whole-ecosystem scale material exchange between the mangrove forest and the adjacent coastal water in the Fukido Mangrove forest, Okinawa, Japan. The outwelling of dissolved C alone from the mangrove estuary greatly exceeded the leaf litter production, implying other major carbon sources such as belowground production and terrestrial inputs.

## Antarctic lake and stream DOM

We're studying the fundamental driver of the DOM concentration and composition in lakes and streams on Sôya Coast (Lützow-Holm Bay, East Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica).
This work was initiated at 58th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE58) in collaboration with the [Bioscience Group](https://www.nipr.ac.jp/english/research/group/biology.html) of National Institute of Polar Research in Japan. Molecular-level analysis of the Antarctic DOM samples by FT-ICR MS was conducted as a post-doctoral work of Morimaru in Thorsten Dittmar’s [ICBM-MPI Bridging Group for Marine Geochemistry](https://uol.de/en/icbm/marine-geochemistry), University of Oldenburg in Germany.

Future work: Studying the biotic and abiotic controls in pedogenesis of Antarctic soils.

* [Origin, Distributions, and Environmental Significance of Ubiquitous Humic-like Fluorophores in Antarctic Lakes and Streams](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.114901)
* More in prep.
